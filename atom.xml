<p>
Dear S,
</p>


<p>
When you see my email, maybe you don't want to read it anymore, maybe you just want to put an end to everything. 
</p>


<p>
In this past two months, I really have the fear to receive you email, because every time I read, I will blame myself, how could I do all these to you! You are so good and we had so many good moments together, the memories you wrote in the first letter are exactly the memories in my mind. And it feels a little strange, because everything between you and me ended so suddenly... there are still some things which are related to you in my room, every time I see one of them, there is a story behind it… I tried to reply carefully, tried to avoid hurting you, but finally I realized that no matter what I say what I do, I will hurt you anyway, because I couldn’t give you what you want anymore, something has changed in my heart…
</p>


<p>
Now I would like to talk about my feelings to X. At first, I knew that I have to view him as a brother to me, because I already have you, I feel sad, but I could still control my emotion. But as we write more, it seems that he has become part of my life, and writing to him is a so natural thing, I am still really sorry that I hurt you by this way… When I went to London, I felt that I couldn’t control my feeling anymore, that is the reason why I didn’t say no when he asked me…
</p>


<p>
You asked me to listen to the whisper of my heart, then I did it, I made the choice… And I am so sorry for all the sorrows I put on you…
</p>


<p>
Thank you for giving me an positive farewell, it is a nice gesture, and it makes me feel better. Now, I just want to forget the negative memories we had this two months, and only let the beautiful moments we had remain… What I had experienced in this five years have engraved in my memory, it is you that make me into who I am today, I really mean it and I will never forget... and for me, my dearest hope is that I wish nothing but the best for you!
</p>


<p>
Best wishes, and thank you, farewell,
<br>
R

<p>
Dear SLL,
</p>


<p>
I guess now it's time for me to say farewell and fare well to my SLL. So maybe you will allow me to call you like this for the last time.
</p>


<p>
Maybe you guessed, in some sense, I was just pretending to leave. And you may see, in some sense, I was still there in these days, maybe just like in the song <em>Should It Matter</em>. As I said in the first letter, you should learn more about basic knowledge of computer. That means you should change the passwords of any place that you hope it is impossible for me to access. And as I mentioned in the first letter, too, it's so trivial for me to check you hotmail. And you know why, I used it just like my own email address in the last year, booking tickets, attaching files... for you. In fact, it is just a bookmark beside my gmail bookmark and my firefox always remembers the password...
</p>


<p>
Oh, of course, I should not check it definitely after I claimed that we weren't lovers anymore. But... dur dur dur ... la vie... avec laquelle je vivrai quand meme s'il n'y a pas de choix. Thanks for Q's words, it is just what I want to say about why I can't stop to check your emails. Yes, yes, I couldn't stop wanting to know how about you in these days. But, just as I said, on the other side, I don't want to disturb you at all to let you make decisions alone. So this was the only way to get informations about you in distance, in silence.
</p>


<p>
Many apologies again for my dishonorable behaviors.
</p>


<p>
On the other hand, maybe in depths of my heart, I just dreamt that, finally, in your hotmail, I would see something like this: Voyages-sncf.com, Confirmation pour votre voyage B-S... But 20 Oct, what I saw were just many comfirmation letters of sncf to another place, where someone will be able to meet again there. So I see...
</p>


<p>
I'm really sorry to let you feel so negative for the previous letters, messages, phone calls since 31 August...
</p>


<p>
Now I just hope that I could write a non-negative farewell letter to you. So, I just want to let you know - if you still want to know - I live well now... And I just want to say thank you, again. Thanks for studying mathematics together with me in these five years. And I want you know, as for me, it was so nice to have you around for every time you were by my side in these five years... And, I think I learnt a lot by the things happened in these days... So, thank you, forever.
<p>
Au revoir...
</p>
</p>


<p>
Bon voyage d'Avignon, et de la vie.
<br>
S

<p>
Dear Douzi,
</p>


<p>
Please let me to call you like this for one time more... This Sunday, I got the varicella, and I had seen the doctor in Monday, since I still had no room for myself and I don't want to stay in other's room because it is contagious, so I found a hotel and live here myself. The first day was very hard, I had to buy the food for four days although I had the fever and with the chickenpox in my face and body, and then I had to cooked myself although I was off my head... But I didn't cry, I believe that I can manage all of this, and the result is good, I feel much better now, so you don't need to worry about me. Until yesterday, Q gave me a phone call to ask my situation, I told him, it is fine now, finally, he said: we couldn't go to visit you because you get a disease like this, so take care of yourself. After hanging up, I felt a strong desire to cry, to cry not because they couldn't visit me, but because at that moment, I realized that I have really lost you, I have lost the douzi who will always by my side and give me support when I am weak and ill... I cried loudly in the room, I am released that no one can hear me, I could cry as loudly as I want...
</p>


<p>
Maybe this is the feeling you have described to you, in the past three weeks, I tried to keep everything in my life normal, I went to the office everyday and prepared for my course during the weekend, I just don't want to make myself think about this whole things, and I wanted to keep myself busy to have no time to think about it... But now I realized that all I did are futile, like you said, I have to face it, to be brave. This Sunday, I was really down: I got the emotional problem which is hard to sort out, I got the varicella which makes me feel bad, and I got no place to stay... I thought the situation can't be worse anymore. But yesterday, I got the call from Crous that finally they have a spare room for me and the varicella is becoming steady... See, things are working out, so they make me feel that maybe my problems are also not so hard ro sort out. When I was with you, I wouldn't believe that I could face those difficulties by my own, but the truth is, I can do it. What you said is right, you said that maybe leaving me is the only way to make me grow up. And now, I am not that afraid of growing up anymore. I think maybe it is time for me to get sometime to have a rest, to think about what we have gone through in the past five years, the happiness and the sorrows, and why I ended it up by my mistake, and what's more, what is love and what we should do to keep a relation, all these are needed to be done. I never thought carefully before... Five years is a really really long time, you had become a part of my life, you are everywhere in my life, but now I need to learn to live alone, live the life without you, it will be hard to achieve, however, I would like to have a try this time, to see where I will arrive. Maybe after one year, I could still not get used to it, and at that time maybe I will figure out those questions in my head; maybe after one year, I could move on, I will also give you my best wishes, because you always mean a lot to me, you've changed my life to make me a better person, you've given me the comfort when I was in the dark time...
</p>


<p>
Every journey has an end, this one ends, another one will begin, someone will meet again, and someone else will never be able to meet. I know now I have to begin my journey alone, le vent se lève il faut tenter de vivre. I don't know the next time me meet, what the situation it will be, but I hope from my bottom of my heart that the next time we see each other, I could find out that you live your life to the full, and what will happen at that time, who knows?
</p>


<p>
Best wishes, hope your happiness unbounded,
<br>
R

<p>
Dear R,
</p>


<p>
I can imagine how you feel when you see these “Once”s in those titles. In fact, when I wrote them down, I thought I knew, since I had already tasted much your tears in these five years. I have to say I'm really sorry that these words hurt you.
</p>


<p>
But I didn’t want to blame you or hurt you for writing them down, they are just my feelings. I had to put them there, because I felt that I lost something. Some feelings that make me write down that titles.
</p>


<p>
You know, 钱钟书 once wrote some words for 杨绛:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>绝无仅有的结合了各不相容的三者：妻子，情人，朋友。</em></strong>
</p>


<p>
I think I had some similar feelings like this. I guess you can see the similarity between these three words and your titles. But after I knew what you did, these feelings had gone. How could I still claim these titiles in the previous letter as nothing happened, even though I knew the these “Once”s will break your heart?
</p>


<p>
In your letter, you said I am just like a family to you now. But I am sorry to say, maybe I am like a family of yours, but it’s impossible to be true if we define the real families are bonded by blood. Maybe I would be your husband in the future, which perhaps can be called a true family, especially if we have some children. But you shall know, I think we are bonded by some other things, some other feelings that I prefer use other words than family.
</p>


<p>
So, this means that we are NOT bonded eternally. For families, they are bonded by blood, which never can be broken, even by death. Do you remember the Unbreakable Vow? Do you find in fact it can and only can be broken by death? What a pity, and what a luck, to say love is not an Unbreakable Vow. In fact, how fragile the love is, how easy to break it into pieces, though it's maybe crafted by so many days and nights.
</p>


<p>
Therefore, maybe someone will leave away from other one, when our 羁绊 breaks in pieces.
</p>


<p>
On the other hand, what the exact feeling to be a family? If you like to read stories on 知乎, you will find so many sad stories happened in families, so many people wanted to run away from this eternal bond. In such cases, the feeling of family was terrible.
</p>


<p>
Of course, I knew that you meant some good feeling. But what exact feeling was that? In your letter of 19, July, you wrote, your parents would never get interested in the books you read. So I can guess your feeling to me was not like your feelings to your parents, since we shared so many things. And in fact, I couldn't attach myself to any position in your family relations. Brother? Yes, in some sense. But I think it was far more than that in some other sense. In fact, I think our bond was much more beyond any family. As I wrote in the previous letter, once, we were just like siamese twins: we shared all most everything in the everyday life and we spent all most all the time together.
</p>


<p>
But please don’t say that I was like a brother who can help you and share things with you. I was always there to help you and always wanted to share everything with you. But I did those things just because they made me happy. I still remember that several years ago, when sometimes (maybe most times) I went alone to the lectures on history of western literatures, I always found so many things that made me wish that you were just be my side. So we could share them together. Only that desire to share those things with you is enough to make me happy at that times. And we did share many things in these five years, which always brought happiness to me.
</p>


<p>
On the other hand, I never thought I could do something which only your true brother and family can do. That is, if my sister has a boyfriend, even a husband, and if she goes to travel with some other man without telling her boyfriend, if she writes letters in three months without letting her boyfriend know, I won’t blame her, even it’s not good in my opinion. I will just tell her, follow your heart, to find your true love.
</p>


<p>
But what a luck and what a pity, I am not your brother. And so I can’t feel nothing for what you had done, I can’t stop to fall in sorrows, since I am not your brother, but perhaps love you more than a brother in some senses.
</p>


<p>
Anyway, I’m grateful to know that you said I had brought many new possibilities to your life, that you like the things that I appreciate much, that you will treasure our sweet memories. And I’m also happy to see that you found that sometimes I was like a boy who knows nothing and needs your care. I think this is even true in all 26 years since I came to this world, though maybe you didn’t notice this very clearly in our early time. According to some post on 知乎, it maybe just means that I fell in love with you.
</p>


<p>
However, now we know, many many things had been broken, include yours and mines.
</p>


<p>
In your letter of 9, June, you said heartbreakings make us cherish what we have, and I think the loss does, too. I think we had lost many many things now, and I wish we will cherish them next time, if we could have them again.
</p>


<p>
And now you have seen it’s quite abnormal if someone just wants to be your brother without anymore desire. But on the other hand, to like you, to cherish you, to view you as very specious one to himself, to love you, are so normal, since you are so lovely. And much more for me, since we had been together for more than five years, and in which we went through so many things, happy and sad.
</p>


<p>
And you shall know, there is some other thing that is different between I and X. I believe I won’t ask some girl to be my girlfriend if I already know that she has a boyfriend. I still remembered that situation years ago when I asked you if you have a boyfriend. As I guessed, you said none. Not a surprise, but what a happiness to me at that moment. Now, you told X that you had a boyfriend at very beginning. But anyway, it seemed uselesss to stop him from asking you to be his girlfriend finally at 31 August. Maybe, you can learn something from this in the future. As I guess, something you can learn first is, you can’t hope others think as you hope. As you wanted X just to be your brother. What a mistake and a lesson you learn, maybe to your sorrows. And a second lesson I hope you can learn is, you shall say “NO” no matter what others say to ask you to be his girfriend when you already have a boyfriend. Even if you think this one is your true love. Of course, if you like this one much more, you always can break with the first one then try to be close with the other one. But saying that “NO”, is a manner, I guess Dumbledore will agree with me, since Dumbledore always has his manners even before his death.
</p>


<p>
However, though I believe I won’t do such a thing, I can understand it. Otherwise, we won’t like Princess Rhaegar or Jack Dawson. We won't be happy to see that Knox pursues Chris Noel after he is taught to “carpe diem, seize the day”.
</p>


<p>
But what do you hope me to react after all of this? I thought I can’t tolerate that my girlfriend won’t say no within a second. I thought I can’t believe my girlfriend will say she need to time to consider. But now I find I was wrong, I tolerated, and I waited. I guess you know why. But now I have to say, I can’t wait any longer. I’m sorry, le vent se lève, and winter has arrived. And I’m really sorry I break another promise to you.
</p>


<p>
But please feel free to make any decisions. For youself, it doesn’t matter if other ones’ words are moving, only the whisper of your heart does matter. Though maybe this whisper is covered by noise, hard to listen. And please to make decisions, to look forward to the remaining voyage of life, bravely, like Nausicaä; hopefully, like San; and even with great loss, even when le vent se lève.
</p>


<p>
Your once boyfriend,
<br>
S

subject: Re: Words, words, words
</p>


<p>
In this email, I will be totally honest, to myself and to you.
</p>


<p>
When you send me the message that we have been friends for 1981 days, I don't feel surprised, since now for me, you are just like a family, only 5 years are enough to make someone to be your family. I still remember 5 years ago when we are still not familier with each other, you are just a guy who always a little active in the class :-) Then you began to talk to me in QQ, I got surprised at first, but after some chats, I realized that you are special :-) Then you took me to the Dushuhui, in there, I met the people I never seen before. My life before I met you, maybe it was normal just like most of people does, but after I met you, I begin to see so many possibilities it could be! So I have to say, you’ve changed my life. We went to climb the mountain together and walked around the east lake together, those are all the precious memories for me. More importantly, you had recommended me so many books which I never heard before that :-) But I was happy to try them and I really like them. Although at the first, I still thought you are a little strange, the strange looks, the strange clothes and the strange mind:-) But then I got used to it and learned to understand your feelings and read the book you like and take the interesting courses with you, and now I don't think your mind is strange anymore, in the contrary, I think it is great. The strange look, I can do nothing, I still need a time to get used to it if I do not see you for a long time, which I have already told you :-) But I could change your dressing :-). Ok, now it comes to our first kiss, I still remember that you ask many times for the permission, it was odd for me, because I was shy at that time, how could I say, yes, you can kiss me :-) Anyway, you kiss me in the end, it was magnificent, I had never the feeling before that :-) After the first kiss, we had so many time of passion in the campus, they are the memories I won’t forget my whole life… Then, we came to France, and you seems to have problem adapting to the new life here, so things went not so well with you, before this, in Wuhan, your situation is always better than me, so you are just like a big brother to me whom I admire but after we came to France, sometimes I need to support and comfort you when you didn’t find a good place to go, this is a different experience , then we know that we can not only share the happiness but also the sorrow. Finally, you came to B, we spent all most all the days together, and at first there were some problems but slowly we made things out, you really gave me the comfort in this place where we are not familier with, although you always let me to communicate with people which made me feel tired, sometimes I hope you could do this instead of me, but the joy we had is more than this, we watched the movies together, made the lunch and dinner together, and you are always available to carry the heavy bags for me, what’s more, if I have the questions in math and history, you are always there to reply :-) In the last year we spent together, sometimes you are just like a boy knowing nothing whom I need to take care of and sometimes like a big brother who can help me and share things with me. And thank you so much for your birthday present, I can really see you are doing it with your heart, I take the card you gave me all the day, can you understand how I feel when I saw you put a ‘Once’ in all your titles? Heartbreaking…
</p>


<p>
Now I want to talk about my feelings to X which you may be interested in. The first week we met in Wuhan, I had a strange feeling like we had already met before, the feeling of been closed, I don't know why, maybe because he is nice and has something in common with you. Yes, as you wrote in the letter, one week is too short for me to visit him in London, but after that week, when I said goodbye to him, I had the feeling of being sad and depressed but maybe this feeling would go with wind if he didn't send me the email after that. When I found that he had also the feeling of being closed to me, I thought I should tell him that I already had a boyfriend in case he will misunderstand, so I wrote that letter which you have seen, his reply is cool so I feel safety after that letter because I thought I had made things clear. And it was a nice experience writing to him, in the past three month, we got a better knowledge of each other, I am sure he is a nice guy just like you. I had the doubt of my feelings to him for few times, if I didn't meet you, maybe I would like this guy to be honest. But I am also very clear that if I didn't meet you, I won't be the girl today and you are already like family to me, you means a lot to me and I can't leave you just because of him. So I said nothing, in my heart, this frequency of writing letters won't be long, because one day, he will also meet someone he loves and forms a family and I will give him the best wish for this. So when he asked me to visit him in London, I didn't see this is inappropriate, since for me, it is just meeting a good friend. Then it comes to the question, why I didn't tell you about this. I think it carefully these days, I think it is because my feeling to him is special, this is the experience I didn't have before, I am not clear how should I deal with it, and I didn't know how could I told you such things, because maybe you can understand me, but it will hurt you anyway, I don't want to do this for some feeling I am not sure even myself. So I came to London, the first day I arrived, I had called you in the train for many times, but it was impossible to connect. And after I arrived in the hotel, I was too tired because I haven't sleep so well for days and I forgot to leave you a message. I am really sorry to make you so worried. Now I would like to share my trip in London with you. X went to the station to pick me up, I have to say, I was really happy to see him again. It rained almost all the days, but anyway, I like rains, so it was fine to me. He planed everything so carefully, I could see he has prepared it with heart and the plan is really full, so everyday I left in the morning and went back very late and tired. We went to the Promrose hill, that day it rained badly, so it was not a nice weather to go to the hill, but you know what I found? I found out a etching in the top of the hill "I have conversed with the spiritual Sun. I saw him on Primrose Hill" :-) Sounds familier? It is the place where the silver hair girl from Iceland in '8 senses' sees the sunrise! I really want to share the happiness with you at that moment. And X also took me to the seaside near London, it was magnificent! We are both astonished by the beauty of nature. After one week, I think maybe at first I only saw the sameness between you and him, but after this week, I also see some differences between you two, he doesn't read as many history books as you do :-) his connection with his family (parents and sister) is much more than you and me and he had never lost un umbrella :-) Everything was fine until I found out your strangeness. Then I know it is the time to talk with you and him. I began to think carefully what is exactly my feelings to you and him, so now in this letter is what I get these days in my head, it is still not that clear but at least clearer than before. In the last day, I talked to him about you and he also told me his feelings to me, yes you are right, I should never say in hasty what is other's thought. I have to say, what he said to me is moving, just like what you’ve said to me years ago, but this time I couldn't give him the answer, I really need some reflect and thinking…

<p>
I am really sorry that I have sent you this letter, because I can imagine that how the tears come streaming down your face after you read this letter.
</p>


<p>
As for me, I think I am in the darkest hour, minute, second for every hour, minute, second I am breathing, ever since I came to this world. And it is a great challenge for me, so I have to write something down as a response. Though I know, in some sense, what I am doing is just like tilting at a windmill as Don Quixote. What do I mean? I mean this challenge is just in <strong>my</strong> imagination, only lives in <strong>my</strong> mind. Maybe in others' eyes, what happened is noraml as a windmill, but for me, it's a giant. This challenge is just consisting of my memories, feelings, thoughts which are wandering, rushing, rolling day and night in my mind at the moment.
</p>


<p>
So you <strong>DON’T</strong> need to answer any question I ask here, to argue with any words I write here, or even to read anything here at all. What I write here indeed? Oh, just <strong>words, words, words</strong>.
</p>


<p>
<strong>Words are wind</strong>? Maybe, but sometimes, <strong>words hurt more than swords</strong>. And <strong>some wounds never heal, they only scab</strong>.
</p>


<p>
Recently, I read a post in 知乎, which mentioned a notion, love map. It gives scores by your answers to questions related to your lover, in order to give an assessment of your relationship. One of the questions is whether you know all the closest friends of your lover. I didn’t give a second consider when I first saw this question: of course. Until the midnight between 25 and 26 August, I realized how wrong I was. I missed one.
</p>


<p>
Of course, I smelt something earlier, maybe you know which moment is that. Thanks to 知乎, I wanted to use your iPad to take a look at it that night. Thanks to my bad habit of closing all other apps when I use a certain one. So I noticed a mail when I used your ipad. I read it. That was X’s response to your mail on his birthday. I was shocked by some words in that mail. But I pretended that I saw nothing. And when I returned your iPad, I thought I saw something in your eyes. But I said nothing, too. Now, I think, maybe it would lead to a totally different result if I asked you about the mail or you decided to tell me the things by that chance.
</p>


<p>
I suppose you know, at that time, I trusted you through and through (Do you know where I learn this phrase? From Half-Blood Prince, it describes how Harry trusts Dumbledore). And I believe that trust is a very important principle in love relationship. So I thought you will handle it well. Like what you did when Clément’s friend said he hoped to see you again after your first meeting at that running match of pigs. (Though I thought your whole ignorance of him might be a little impolite.) So I didn’t pay any more attention to this. It only came to my mind again until your arrival in London. Your behaviors and words were strange, I could tell, as you always can find it when mines are strange.
</p>


<p>
Unlike your travel to Copenhagen, you said nothing where you went, what you did, whom your meet, how you felt. In fact, no message at all for your first night in London. So I lost connection to you even without knowing <strong>whether you had arrived safely</strong> at all. Such thing was not the first time, so I began to worry just as before. Did you realize how important is your safety to me? (<strong>No need</strong> to answer, as I wrote above.)
</p>


<p>
And when at last I called you successfully, you said you were outside and just asked me that if there was something practical. Then the call ended. Well, at that time, all my attention was concerning on the fact that you had arrived safely. So I didn’t give a thought to why you were seemed to be unconventional to talk with me, why you seemed to behave a little strangely.
</p>


<p>
But you still told me nothing about your trip until 25, August. So I checked your hotmail, and I found you hadn’t booked any hotel at all. I couldn’t understand. Did you go to Reading directly? Did you use another email address? But this is usual email you used for booking a hotel.
</p>


<p>
So, all this led to some rough idea. And I was tormented by this idea. Finally, just at that midnight, I found that I happened to have a dishonor way to check it. Yes, I loaded in your email box of university, which happened to be the only place you used a lot but I didn't know the password. (You should learn more about basic knowledge of computer.) In fact, I wasn’t interested in this mail box at all since you only used it for something practical, especially, for something related to math.
</p>


<p>
Then, I knew,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>I know nothing.</em></strong>
</p>


<p>
I suppose you received the offer of X at 22, May for the travel of London in the letter of that day, right? Anyway, this <strong>doesn’t</strong> matter. What matters, then? I think it’s that I knew <strong>nothing</strong> about your acceptance of the offer, your plans of travel, your letters in these three months.
</p>


<p>
I knew that you will go to England, I knew you will go to visit Xm in Reading. And in August, you mentioned that Q said you could go to visit X, so I knew you <strong>maybe</strong> go to visit him (in a totally different sense). Of course, this is your trip, you needn’t ask my permission or tell me your plan. And you knew me, I also had no will to know your plan (since I didn't go with you). Because, I <strong>thought</strong> you will tell me <strong>all</strong> you want to share with me when you travel to England. But you even didn’t tell me X will meet you at train station in London. If I <strong>knew</strong> this at least, there would be much less worries about your safety when I lost the connection with you.
</p>


<p>
If I go to travel with some girl <strong>alone</strong> for a week, I <strong>believe</strong> I will let you know it. Moreover, I <strong>believ</strong>e I will ask you if you mind it. In fact, I <strong>believe</strong> I will never do such a travel no matter what a friend the girl is to me. Yes, of course, if I go to travel with my sister, I won’t ask for your opinion, but I think I will share every interesting thing with you. But I <strong>DIDN’T</strong> know X now is your new brother until that midnight. In fact, I <strong>DIDN’T</strong> know he even can be called your friend. Yes, sometimes you told me a little of this, a bit of that about him. And I agreed with you that we have many things in common. But it was too hard for me to figure out this surprise you gave to me. Too less clues if this surprise was another birthday gift for me which you prepared for a long time.
</p>


<p>
I think it’s really nice experience to read your and X’s letters, I mean it, if I were someone else. I can remember some similar feelings when I was writing letters with Sq when I was in my high school. Due to the inefficient post system in China at that time, I wrote a letter, then it took one week for her to receive, and another week for me to receive the reply. I remember the feelings how I accounted the days in the waiting for the next letter, how fast my heart beaten with the letter in my hand, and how excited when I finally read the letter when there was no one around. You asked me about this several times, but it is not that I don’t want to share my memories and feelings with you. It’s just the time, eight years. I didn’t keep the letters. I can’t remember any practical thing we discussed, any feelings we shared. And I don’t know how to express clearly such faraway, faded scenes, emotions, feelings. And I joked that what a pity you didn’t have such an experience when you were in high school. Now, I think, I can say there is no more pity for you on this thing.
</p>


<p>
As I remembered, what we had written were naïve. And they were not love letters, even no strong emotions were ever expressed. In fact, I think I never used to expressed emotions and feelings strongly or directly - as you may feel - though perhaps there was great tempest inside of some peaceful words.
</p>


<p>
Oh, there is one thing I wrote to her I won’t forgot. They are just some simple words: I wish I could be her friend forever. Now, are we still friends eight years later? You know, every year we just had several messages or even zero to each other. She is on her way of the voyage of life, I am on mine. She shared things through her QQ zone, and I read it from time to time, in silence. I said nothing to her no matter she met happiness or sadness, even her birthday. I just - as a friend - wish her living a happy life, meeting some true love with someone else. The friendship in Papillon is moving, truly, but I feel it's lucky that most of us never meet such a case in real life. So I think, there is another kind of friendship, which is silent like peaceful lake water. I just stand at a long distance, happy to see that a old friend lives well, that's enough for me. Because I know, I have a unique, a special friend just before my eyes in recent five years. No, maybe I should say I had.
</p>


<p>
You know, there are other two close friend of mine. One of them is a girl, Ff, I guess you have more interests. I hope you noted that I paid very attention to the distance between us, since you have read all the message between us on QQ. Because I always knew that I had promised something to you. And I believe a promise is a promise, as Forrest Gump told Lieutenant Dan about the shrimp boat. I hope you remember what I promised, it was that question which I borrowed from ending of Whisper of the Heart, I asked it after our long long kiss in that little woods. Your answer was yes, but I know, at that time, how could you say no or say that you need time to consider it. In fact, more earlier, when I asked you to be my girlfriend at that summer of 2010, when you replied with a yes. I had promised something to you already, though I just kept it in my heart. That is, I view the establishing of a relation as a promise, which means that there is something I should never try to do. So, just immediately after that, when I met Ff in that August, when I found she is special to me, I knew I must be careful to the distance, becasue I had a promise for you.
</p>


<p>
I don't know what do you think of her from the deep of your heart, but I guess you don't dislike her at least, especially after she accompanied you on that nights, on which you had to live alone in that house. Moreover, I remember you once asked me, what would happend if I met her first. I told you the truth, and you were sad. I'm sorry I was so stubborn, it was so easy to say something nice to you, but I chosed to say the truth to you. However, it's just an assumption, maybe happened in another universe.
</p>


<p>
What really happend in this world is that I met you first, and I am stubborn. So, then we went through these five years together. You encountered two terrible time in these five years. The first time, you even didn't tell me the thing unitl the end of winter, the begin of new semester. I could imagine that it was because you didn't totally trust me at that time, you didn't know what will I react. I could understand, we just began our relationship half a year, you didn't know me well at that time. But, then, I knew, you knew me from now on, that I am stubborn. You knew that I am alwasy there, stand by you, never leave. Until now.
</p>


<p>
I kept this promise, I paid attension, I reminded myself to be careful because I know it’s easy to say love, to promise, but it's a different thing to maintain it. It never be easy. If it was easy, there would not be so many sad love stories on 知乎. So I have to be careful to the distance to other girls. Since I know such thing may lead to hurt you, which I never want.
</p>


<p>
And I still keep the promise, so I <strong>won’t</strong> break our relation first.
</p>


<p>
Love, as a word, is so easy to say, and maybe, is also easy to begin, but it never be easy to maintain as I must say again. So I preferred to be careful with this word as you may felt in these years. But I did want to achieve this word, as I view it as a promise until my death. And I tried.
</p>


<p>
The promise is one of the three vertices of the love triangular. Another vertex is closeness. When I first knew by that accident you had skyped with X, I was just in the pure shock how could you accomplish this: to skype without letting someone <strong>knew</strong>, someone who lived together with you day and night in a room of 9 square meters in this year. Later, when I found you had written so many letters at so many nights and had another time of Skype. I was not shocked anymore, I just <strong>felt</strong> how wrong I was if I thought you were sitting just one meter behind me when you were writing these letters at those night. As for the Skype, I <strong>felt</strong> that it seemed I didn't live with you together at all. Maybe all these letters are just my imagination, or living with you together is a hallucination? (<strong>No</strong> need to answer, again. They are just feelings, just words.) I <strong>never</strong> think you have no right to write or to skype to anyone you want. But I was just too confusing, and shocked, since according the time you skyped around the end of June and my poor memory, I think I should be there, just before your eyes. Where were you, where was I? How far away is the distance between you and me? How couldn’t I know such thing? Why you told me <strong>nothing</strong>?
</p>


<p>
I have to emphasize again, I <strong>don’t</strong> blame you or accuse of anything. I am just terribly trapped by my feelings and thoughts. And I’m really sorry if you feel some negative emotions when you read my letter. But, on the other hand, I think this would be a lesson.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>Life is not a song, sweetling. Someday you may learn that, to your sorrow.</strong></em>
</p>


<p>
We have to face these negative things in our lives, we can’t be children forever, and winter is always coming. So, as I imagine, you will also receive a challenge as you received this letter. Not coming from me, it comes from yourself as I suppose. But I hope you to be brave. Like Harry, braveness is not fearless, but go forward to face the challenge with your fear.
</p>


<p>
And I must also apologize for reading your emails without your permission. And for X, too.
</p>


<p>
So I thought I had mistaken another thing. I thought you agreed with me that we share <strong>everything</strong>. But now I see maybe you want more private room in fact, otherwise I think you won’t tell me nothing at all from 10 May to 25 August. But you never mentioned it, you never say you want to have some close friend without need to let me know.
</p>


<p>
Yes, in fact, I don’t agree with this: lovers can keep their close friends without letting the other know.
</p>


<p>
Back to five years ago, when I was trying to get close with you, you said you agreed with me that 杨绛 and 钱钟书 are an idealistic model for lovers. It should not be 徐志摩 with 张幼仪, 林徽因, or 陆小曼, as I suppose our likings of tragedy doesn't mean we want it to happen on ourselves.
</p>


<p>
How luckily, I saw we were on a way as we hoped, to follow them. Now I can’t even remember when we began to know each other's passwords for QQ, mail boxes, etc. They were so natural as I felt. Without I realized, we checked mails, we read messages, we handled the everyday practical things, we used our bank cards, without considering to distinguish you and me. I knew all your close friend before May 2015, and you knew all mines too. And you could even use my QQ to imitate me to talk with my sister with nothing sensed by my sister. And I was so happy to see that we had more and more things loved by both of us. On the other hand, I also thought we had more and more tolerances on our differences.
</p>


<p>
I never required you to have the ideal, principal, hobby - which I treasure - as the same with me if I remember rightly. And I never want our relation to be your 围城 which traps you. Whenever you want to leave, to be outside, please just let me know. And I do hope you can be rid of any sorry, pressure, guilty for doing so.
</p>


<p>
And, of course, I must say, thank you, thank you for spending these five years with me. Thanks for your not running away when I always sat down beside you in linear algebra courses. Thanks for your supports on the seminar affairs until the last in the second year of our college time. Thanks for your acceptances of my invitations to take those courses in the university: the history of modernization of universities, an introduction to western cultures, the history of western literatures, the thirteen lectures on Weimar Republic, an introduction to the culture of Ancient Greek, the analysis of dramas of Shakespeare. Thanks for all your gifts you sent me on my every birthday in these years. Thanks for watching so many movies together with me… The list can be extended much much longer, and longer if we could have five years after five years.
</p>


<p>
But I am sorry that I can’t say I could extend it forever. Forever, a beautiful word, truly. But I suppose that you noted I said it very very few. Sometimes you wanted some promise from me, but you heard no this word. Since I intend to be very careful with this word. Why? Because I know it’s easy to say, but it is also easy to be gone with wind. But I desired this word for us with my whole heart, otherwise I wouldn't like to send you a ring with symbol ∞ as in 时尼的肖像 by Shinji Kajio. I was so happy that I could sent you Tiffany Infinity as the Christmas gift of this year. I could still recall that night, due to my stupidness, I had to walk a long way back, with a Tiffany Infinity in my arms. At that time, I was walking alone on a country road along those dark woods in the weak moonlight, without any human being, any car, any house light, or even any animal or even any sounds around. But I wasn't afraid, I thought it was just something interesting, some story we could recall for fun when we are old and grey many years later. And I believe I will be much happier when I could claim that, I loved and will love you forever, just before my last breath.
</p>


<p>
But who knows future? How can I make sure that I can keep the promise if I wasn't a foreteller? What I am sure includes the past, and I hope you can always find happiness in our five years spent together whenever you recall them. What I can control, includes, though maybe not totally, is now, this very moment. So I will try my best to keep the words I said to you in the past. I don’t like to say anything I can’t 100% sure to you. So I can only use this word, forever, in that card I gave you, I mean it by my heart.
</p>


<p>
But I know, to be a man of his words is hard. I never think I kept all my words to others. And now, there are some words gone with wind: I won’t be back to B soon after my arrival in Germany, for the baggage (I will take away all I need), and for you, any more.
</p>


<p>
I think our five years together can be viewed as the opening chapter of your and mine unique voyages of life, with so much happiness and some sadness, with so much laughter and some tears. Though I thought I would have only one chapter through the begin to the end.
</p>


<p>
But I wish you, as written in that card, thousandfold love, on your 25th Nameday and forever, and happiness unbounded, though even if you don't want to run after them together with me any more.
</p>


<p>
Well, after so many words, words, words, I think I feel much better now. In fact, from that midnight to this very moment, when I am writing this letter beyond the earth ten kilometers, on my flight from Wuhan to Paris, I can’t sleep at all. Especially from that midnight to the sunset of 26 August, I turned over and over, my mind was totally out of my control. Then what a relief when I heard my nephew, my sister and my brother-in-law were getting up, because then I only needed to pretend as I had a nice sleep for a small while. But when I went through half of Wuhan city to fix your computer and return the computer to your mother, I felt myself like a walking dead. Where I came from? Who was I? Where was I going? My mind seemed to be empty and full at the same time. And I can guess my smile was rather ugly when I met your mother at Z Station.
</p>


<p>
However, such agony is nothing, I think.
</p>


<p>
After so many words, I am also wondering if I should turn from mathematics to writings like 王小波? No, no, no, I think I can't write down such words:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>人的一切痛苦，本质上都是对自己的无能的愤怒。</strong></em>
</p>


<p>
Now it's midnight of 31 August. I will soon finish this letter and sent it to you, as you required. I planed to leak nothing to you to let you find that I know the things now. But it's really hard than I thought. It's so easy for you to find that I behaved strangely. I'm sorry for this.
</p>


<p>
You asked me if I am angry on 28 August. I said no, as I am not angry to you. But maybe I should say yes, because I am angry to myself, as Wang pointed out.
</p>


<p>
And I have to admit that I am envious too. In your letter on X’s birthday, you said you felt you could talk anything with him now. This seems really faster than the steps of you and me if you really meant it.
</p>


<p>
They are kind words, I know, just like many other words in your letters. Kind words to someone, but maybe poisoned wine to someone else, as I feel. I imagine, if you knew I will read all words written by you, like we usually did, would you still write like what I read? I suppose you never want to hurt anyone as intended. But you know Eddard Stark well, he intended to hurt no one, he behaved as his nature, a honorable, justice nobleman. But what he did led to his own death, to his wife's death, to his oldest son’s death, to the fall of his family, to the war and chaos of whole kingdom. Did he do anything wrong? Anyway, I never blame him. If Teiresias can speak, I guess he will say that it will come what will. You are so kind, you response kind words by kind words, passion by passion. But how can you be kind to all the people at the same time?
</p>


<p>
On the other hand, I am pondering, what if they are just words, like wind? If so, what is true feeling of you? Why did you say these words? I don’t know what X will feel in such possibility. But I guess it won't be positive. Are you the Mirror of Erised, always projects others to yourself to bring happiness to others? Sometimes I doubt. No, I hope this is not true. Please listen to the whisper of your heart, <strong>become who you are</strong>.
</p>


<p>
X replied that he thought one look is enough to know what you are thinking. I thought I could, too, and I guess it lasted for some time, maybe at least to May 2015. But now, I find it become really hard. Why you said you had seen many times of the Zhao Ruhan’s pen name in 科幻世界? I feel that it is because that such a white lie can make your words more dramatic. But what a drama the reality is, as now we may see. Do you agree with me about this?
</p>


<p>
In your letters, there is so much passion, closeness, and plans. And it made me feel that I was nobody to you, or I didn’t exist at all. Yes, you mentioned you have a boyfriend at the beginning. But that’s all. If I was the person you cared for most, you loved most, as you said on 30 August, why you didn’t mention me after that? Had you ever visited Louvre alone, or with someone else? Where did you get the book Der Zauberberg? How did you know Nibelungenlied? I can see, in many many times, I should be there in your stories that you shared with X, but why you didn’t mention me? Did you think a close friend or a brother will mind you mention your boyfriend? X shared a lot about his sister, his family and you also mentioned you family. But if I was the person as you told me, why I didn’t appear at all in such places?
</p>


<p>
If you could talk anything with him, why did you say it was Q’s course made you decided to be his Ph.D student? I don’t mean it was a lie, but according to my memory, there were more. If you explain it through and through, can you till avoid that I appeared in your story?
</p>


<p>
Maybe I am just too blind. When you asked me to help you with the typing of notes of seminars this summer, I just thought you wanted to be lazy for a while to relax. Now I can’t stop to think that in fact you were so busy with something else. And maybe you were so busy that you had failed to prepare a gift for my birthday.
</p>


<p>
These are just words, you <strong>don’t</strong> need to defend. What I want to say is, <strong>words are wind</strong>, it’s easy to say something, but what can you do indeed for it? You said you care me most, but what do you think how will I feel when I read these words you wrote? What do you think how will I feel when I find you told me nothing about something in more than three months?
</p>


<p>
And when you said it’s better in some sense for us to live separated in next year, I agreed with you. I knew is based on our deep understanding of each other. And at that moment, I never thought the distance in physics will depart us, or make us distance. But now how can I stop to think that maybe there is some other reason you don’t want to tell me? If I still live with you together when X comes to B, what a situation will it be? If I knew nothing, when we sit together around a table in the restaurant of university, what will happen? I will just think he is a visitor, but he maybe think he is your brother, as you think so. How will you behave, what will you say? <strong>No</strong> need to answer these bad guesses, please, I just need to write down what I think, let it hurt, and then it maybe scab.
</p>


<p>
Maybe I just got into another parallel universe like Coherence from time to time? The one I thought was you, in your letters, in fact live in another parallel universe? And I happened to connect your mail box in a different universe? How I wish this is true.
</p>


<p>
Does this sound I am blaming you? I <strong>don't</strong> want to blame you, and I do <strong>not</strong> blame you. Moreover, please don't blame yourself, too, or fall to some negative emotions. No one have the right to ask you be truly honest to him or her. But please be honest to yourself. What do you want, whom do you want to be, what life do you want to live, what is the true feeling in your heart?
</p>


<p>
Sometimes, when we were angry with each other, I think you found that I always preferred to say nothing. Yes, I know in such time, it’s so easy to say some words that hurt you. But I never want to hurt you. So I preferred to be silent. But this time, I write my feelings, my thoughts through and through. I know they will hurt you this time and I am so sorry. But please don’t cry. And please be brave.
</p>


<p>
And I will be brave, too, to face my sorrow. I felt I was young Werther five years ago when I met you (Yes, I knew it sounded stupid later), now maybe I have to admit that I turn out to be Albert at last. You can try to imagine, if you were me, when someone else said he is always together with your - well, I don't repeat the titles anymore - in his heart and thought, now and forever. What would you think? No, I have to say again, you <strong>needn't</strong> to response to anything here. I was just battling with myself, just mad at myself. I have to write my thoughts, my feelings, which haunt in mind without any stop, in order to face my sorrows.
</p>


<p>
Do you know what Mr. Wang said about how to seize some courage in his course of the history of western literatures? Oh, we can always draw some courage from death. Think of death, be afraid of death, then maybe you could find something terrible is not worth to be afraid any more. So please to live bravely, like Nausicaä, to live hopefully, like San, and to live even with great loss, even when le vent se lève.
</p>


<p>
And please listen to the whisper of your heart, please make decisions carefully.
</p>


<p>
Let us suppose that I hadn’t existed at all. Would you still claim that X is brother to you and you are a sister to him? And he? Or if you are single from now on, without considering the influence of me, would you keep this relation with him forever without going head more? And he? You don’t need to say any words to me so hastily as you did on 30 August. You don’t need to say that you <strong>think</strong> he <strong>feels</strong> that you are just a sister to him. Maybe it matters what I think, what he feels, but, to you, what matters most is yours. So please listen to the whisper of your heart.
</p>


<p>
Oh, at last, there is another thing I promised to share with you. It’s the story of House Targaryen, in fact, of Egg. When I read the history of House Targaryen, I found George R. R. Martin had written it as his consistent harshness. At some page, you can find a little lovely princess bring to so much laughter to the old king, but just on the next page, you will find what a ruthless ruler she become. But what a relief, Martin finally wrote some story different, about the king Aegon V, named Egg by his brother, maester Aemon. One of things he did unusually and bravely is, to marry for love. When every lord plays the game of thrones, how can he be run for love as his will. Even Eddard Stark can’t do this, as you know. Moreover, all his children followed their father’s example, which brought much trouble, you know, marriages of a king’s children are just tools for the game. And his grand grandson, Rhaegar, also made some decisions that shocked the kingdom, and shattered the kingdom, for true love. So, now in modern time, is it easier or harder to acquire the true love? So, please listen to your whisper of heart. And remember, the path of love never be smooth, whether in ancient or modern times.
</p>


<p>
And please be thoughtful, be careful, be brave to make decisions. Do you remember maester Aemon imagines conversations with Egg before he passes away in Season 5? That is quite different with the original book. But some words he says to Egg in the book are kept (for John Snow):
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Kill the boy within you, I told him the day I took the ship for the Wall. It takes a man to rule. An Aegon, not an Egg. Kill the boy and let the man be born.</em>
<br>
Aemon is leaving for the Wall, to let Egg rule alone as a true king. But he knows, though Egg has already grown sons of his own, yet in some ways Egg is still a boy, still has an innocence, a sweetness which Aemon loves. But, as I guess, and according to the Egg’s rule later, it is always not easy to make decisions, even after be mature. And when John Snow also feels hard to make some decision, Aemon said this again (maybe a little different from Season 5):
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>I think you have the strength in you to do the things that must be done. Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy and let the man be born.</em>
</p>


<p><em>
S,
<br>
once humble maester of Citadel Fanart,
<br>
wishes thousandfold love,
<br>
on her 25th Nameday and forever,
<br>
and happiness unbounded.
</em></p>

Good. Thanks for letting me know. By the way, for the Eurostar, you have to check-in at least 30min before the departure, so allow enough time and make sure not to miss it :-b Just joking, I am sure you know and will be there in time :-) It's good that everything is fine.

Are you on the train now? Have you decided how to travel from Paris? Let me know if you need help. And if you like, you can call me whenever it is convenient for you.
</p>


<p>
Don't worry to much about it. These things happen. I'm sure that in the end, you'll make it, and everything will be fine :-)

OK. Before you book your flight: I was just thinking that maybe, you could still take the Eurostar, even if it is more expensive. The reason is that it would be more convenient, and also, it will be reimbursed anyway. I leave it up to you. Just think about it, and let me know.

Dear R,
</p>


<p>
yes, I agree, the most important thing is that we can finally meet again; everything else is secondary, or in other words, we'll make things work out as we are together :-)
</p>


<p>
It's great that you enjoyed the conference in Copenhagen. It seems that you've seen more of the city than me :-) I have only been there for a research visit, which was very productive. While that is good, it also means that I didn't have time for other things apart from maths :-( Well, I'm sure that overall, you had a very very interesting summer, and I look forward to hear more about it. At the same time, you must have worked a lot, and you have been traveling non-stop recently. So it is good to have a break, enjoy some holidays, and relax a bit :-)
</p>


<p>
Now, in less than a day I will finally see you again :-D :-D :-D I look forward to welcoming you, the thought of it alone makes me sooo happy, and soon, it is really and finally going to happen :-) So, have a safe journey, and: See you tomorrow!!
</p>

<p>
Yes, I will arrive on Sunday (23 August) at 15:30 at London St-Pancras, it's really nice to see you again :-) And I have checked the weather forecast in London, it seems that it will rain all the days in next weak, so surely, I will bring an umbrella :-) For me, it is already a great pleasure to spend the week with you, so it would be fun anyway no matter we could find the places or not :-D
</p>


<p>
Today is the end of the workshop, and last talk by Stuart White was cancelled for some reasons, so I got some time to go around the city, we took a boat tour in Copenhagen, and after the dinner, we walked along the river. I'm glad to come to this conference, the talks are good and I also meet a lot of people here. Tomorrow I will come back to B, and the day after tomorrow I can go to London finally :-)
</p>

Dear R,
</p>


<p>
yes, I share your feelings, I have also been waiting for your visit for a long long time, the desire to see you again grows every day ... And I am sure that your wish will come true. We will definitely find a way so that I can also visit you. It is so kind of you to have this wish! Indeed, I really hope that we will see each other often in the future, because I want to be with you :-)
</p>


<p>
Well, maybe it is better not to have high expectations on my abilities as a guide. I mean, I will try my best, obviously. But as I wrote, in my case, it is already a success if I manage to find the places we want to go to ;-) In all these plannings, one thing I have no influence on is the weather. So that is why it would be good if you could bring an umbrella. It might sound stupid, but I always have the feeling that if one doesn't bring an umbrella, then it will rain for sure :-D Moreover, if you want, and if it is possible, you could also bring all your receipts (for visa, travel, ...) so that we can sort out reimbursement while you are here. And yes, your plans for 31 August sound good, taking a train at around one or two in the afternoon will be fine. Concerning your question on exchanging money, that will be no problem at all, London is full of banks, there is even a tube station called Bank; this means that even a guy like me will find one ;-) When I need foreign money, I usually just go to an ATM and use the credit card provided by my German bank. If you have that, too, then it's even easier. In any case, we can always just go to a bank.
</p>


<p>
Oh, before I forget, just let me make sure: You are arriving on Sunday (23 August) at 15:30 at London St Pancras, with a Eurostar, right? I will then pick you up at the station :-)
</p>


<p>
So, is the conference going well? And when are you going back, on Saturday?
</p>


<p>
Best wishes,
<br>
X

Dear X,

<p>
I'm sure you have made very good plans for our trip, and I'm also really happy that I could spend my one-week vacation with you in the summer and I've expected it for such a long time :-) Moreover, I also wish that you could visit me after, in B or in Wuhan, and then I can arrange the trip for you :-)
</p>


<p>
Here is my telephone: +33 7 ** ** ** **. I have noted down your number and your address just in case and thank you for these information, you are very thoughtful :-) For the plans in 31 August, since my friend's time is very flexible, she stays in Reading all the days in the August and September, so she told me that I can choose anytime for the train to there, and just phone her before I get on the train. She also told me that I could just buy the ticket before the departure, I've searched in Virgin trains, there is a train every 10 min, so that would be convenient I think :-) Concerning that you should take the airplane at 18:45, I think maybe sometime around one or two o'clock would be good, maybe? There is one more thing, the day I came back to B from Wuhan, I went to the bank to exchange euros to pounds, but the bank told me that there are no pounds in B and they need to get them from Paris and it takes 10 days, finally, I didn't get what I want. So I need to exchange after I arrive London, could you please take me to the bank or some other place where I could get the pounds maybe?

Dear R,
</p>


<p>
it is great that you are enjoying the conference, and that you like the talks. I am sure that you can learn a lot. And yes, Muenster is a special place. The research group is huge and of very high quality, and there is lots of funding available. That is why I think that academically, I grew up in paradise :-) Thinking back, I will of course keep my time in Muenster in very good memory. At the same time, I am also glad that I moved somewhere else, because now that I realize how special Muenster is, I can appreciate it even more, and I can also become more independent.
</p>


<p>
You are so nice, and simply too polite :-) As I wrote, making these arrangements is part of the fun, and it is a great pleasure for me to prepare for your visit :-D And no worries, to be on the safe side, I have already bought tickets for the drama and the musical on Monday. So everything is fine. You know, I am just so happy that you can come to visit. It will be truly wonderful to see you again :-) By agreeing to come, and by sorting out all these issues with your visa and your travel arrangements, you have already made your contribution, and I am more than happy to do my part :-)
</p>


<p>
Yes, I feel the same about visiting places and becoming part of stories; in some sense, it feels like that the stories become alive. And to add to that, I also think that once we have visited the places we want to visit, we will keep them in our memories and think about them differently, so that in some sense, these places become part of our own story...
</p>


<p>
I don't think we will need them, but let us exchange mobile phone numbers, just in case. Mine is +44 754 *******.
</p>


<p>
Also, again just to be on the safe side, let me give you the address and phone number of my office:
<br>
X L
<br>
School of Mathematical Sciences
<br>
?? University of London
<br>
?? Road
<br>
London E* ***
<br>
phone: +44 20 **** ****
</p>


<p>
And here is my private address:
<br>
X L
<br>
21A G*******
<br>
London E** ***
<br>
</p>


<p>
Moreover, may I ask: Have you now made concrete plans for 31 August, after your visit? I am flying back to Germany on 31 August in the evening, at 18:45, so I will have plenty of time.
</p>

<p>
The course by the main speakers are very nice and there are really a lot of people coming here, I'm sure Munster has a big group for oa, it seems to me that if I ask a guy where does he comes from, the answer is always Munster :-)
</p>


<p>
It is really nice of you that you make all this arrangements :-) and I'm sure that you will take me to a very lovely place, I'm looking forward to see it, in fact, I've already begun to think about what kind of place it will be, there are many pictures in my head now :-) Yes, when some place is related to a story, it will always makes me excited that if I could visit that place as if I become part of the story and I could better understand the feeling of people in the story. I searched "War horse" in the internet, yes, it is a really moving story, if we get the time, maybe we could watch it, but I'm not sure time permits or not, and by the way, should we buy the ticket now for the musical and drama? Maybe I can do it in the internet now, you've done lots of the things for our trips, so I hope I could also contribute at least a little bit to it :-)

Dear R,
</p>


<p>
oh, your journey to Copenhagen really sounds like an odyssey ;-) Hopefully, the way back will be better. So, how was the first day? And have you met many people?
</p>

"A Midsummer Night's Dream" sounds great. Let's go to that. Another drama which sounds nice is "War Horse". Have you read the description? I found out that there was a movie about the same novel. Both the movie and the drama are supposed to be very moving. But I don't know whether you would like it. Anyway, now we already have "Matilda" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream". We can decide together whether we would like to watch "War Horse" as well. Let's see.

I have bought train tickets, for three trips, to Oxford, Cambridge, and another one. The third one is to a place I like very much, and I want you to see it as well. You will know when we get there. I won't tell you more right now, because if you don't mind, I'd like to make it a little surprise :-) Talking about Cambridge, I am really glad that we decided to go there, because I suddenly remembered a novel I read a long time ago. It was written by Christopher Wilkins and is called "The Measure of Love". It also appeared under the title "The Horizontal Instrument", but I like the first title better. It is about a very moving love story, and it begins in Cambridge :-) Another reason I look forward to the trip...
