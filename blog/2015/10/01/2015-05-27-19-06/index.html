Dear R,
</p>


<p>
I like your picture of mathematics. It actually reminds me of an article of Atiyah, who also compares mathematics with architecture. I've attached it, in case you are interested. Creativity is a fascinating subject, it is the beauty and challenge of mathematics at the same time. When I was in Germany, I took part in a project about creativity. The goal was to write a book discussing this topic from the perspective of all kinds of subjects. There were articles about creativity and biology, creativity and law, creativity and religion, creativity and music ..., and I also wrote something about creativity and mathematics. Moreover, we interviewed scientists and artists about their opinion. It was interesting to compare the roles creativity plays, and we realized that although the subjects are very different, there are common features. For instance that it's mysterious how we get ideas, they seem to come out of nowhere. But really, thinking about it, we realize that there is a long process of preparation (sometimes unconscious); that's what you describe as hard work.
</p>


<p>
Last weekend, my sister told me that she wants to a PhD in mathematics. It was quite a surprise for me, since last time we spoke, she was uncertain what she wants to do. But now she seems to be really determined. From my point of view, I just want her to find something she loves, any subject really, but that it will be mathematics is of course wonderful. My sister is now finishing her second year, and she plans to do her master in England, maybe in Cambridge. I hope that one day, you'll be able to meet her. I think that you two would have lots of things to talk about, since your situations are somewhat similar; and since your are more senior, my sister could learn something from you :-D
</p>


<p>
Yes, I just finished marking. This time it was quick: I started yesterday morning, and now I'm already done! Maybe the exam was too easy, or maybe my students really understood something *daydream*, or maybe I really wanted to answer your question with YES, but I was very efficient this time :-) I'm glad it's over.
</p>


<p>
Great that you like Papillon. It's funny that you mention the end, that's also my favourite part of the movie. I just felt so happy, because he was so determined, and longing so much to be free. Talking about determination, I was also impressed by the part where he is suffering so much in prison, isolated, in a narrow room, with almost no food, but still he wouldn't say the name of his friend. That's true friendship...
</p>


<p>
No no, you're not making any fuss at all, I'm actually glad that I have someone to tell the story, it's much better than keeping it to myself. And thanks for your warm words, they went straight into my heart, where I will keep them as a treasure. Thank you :-)
</p>


<p>
Best wishes,
<br>
X
