<p><em>
To her most lovely Maiden,
<br>
R,
<br>
the First of Her Name,
<br>
Princess of the Lotus,
<br>
Once Best Friend of the Melon,
<br>
Once Sweetest Mate of the Bean,
</em></p>


<p>
I am really sorry that I have sent you this letter, because I can imagine that how the tears come streaming down your face after you read this letter.
</p>


<p>
As for me, I think I am in the darkest hour, minute, second for every hour, minute, second I am breathing, ever since I came to this world. And it is a great challenge for me, so I have to write something down as a response. Though I know, in some sense, what I am doing is just like tilting at a windmill as Don Quixote. What do I mean? I mean this challenge is just in <strong>my</strong> imagination, only lives in <strong>my</strong> mind. Maybe in others' eyes, what happened is noraml as a windmill, but for me, it's a giant. This challenge is just consisting of my memories, feelings, thoughts which are wandering, rushing, rolling day and night in my mind at the moment.
</p>


<p>
So you <strong>DON’T</strong> need to answer any question I ask here, to argue with any words I write here, or even to read anything here at all. What I write here indeed? Oh, just <strong>words, words, words</strong>.
</p>


<p>
<strong>Words are wind</strong>? Maybe, but sometimes, <strong>words hurt more than swords</strong>. And <strong>some wounds never heal, they only scab</strong>.
</p>


<p>
Recently, I read a post in 知乎, which mentioned a notion, love map. It gives scores by your answers to questions related to your lover, in order to give an assessment of your relationship. One of the questions is whether you know all the closest friends of your lover. I didn’t give a second consider when I first saw this question: of course. Until the midnight between 25 and 26 August, I realized how wrong I was. I missed one.
</p>


<p>
Of course, I smelt something earlier, maybe you know which moment is that. Thanks to 知乎, I wanted to use your iPad to take a look at it that night. Thanks to my bad habit of closing all other apps when I use a certain one. So I noticed a mail when I used your ipad. I read it. That was X’s response to your mail on his birthday. I was shocked by some words in that mail. But I pretended that I saw nothing. And when I returned your iPad, I thought I saw something in your eyes. But I said nothing, too. Now, I think, maybe it would lead to a totally different result if I asked you about the mail or you decided to tell me the things by that chance.
</p>


<p>
I suppose you know, at that time, I trusted you through and through (Do you know where I learn this phrase? From Half-Blood Prince, it describes how Harry trusts Dumbledore). And I believe that trust is a very important principle in love relationship. So I thought you will handle it well. Like what you did when Clément’s friend said he hoped to see you again after your first meeting at that running match of pigs. (Though I thought your whole ignorance of him might be a little impolite.) So I didn’t pay any more attention to this. It only came to my mind again until your arrival in London. Your behaviors and words were strange, I could tell, as you always can find it when mines are strange.
</p>


<p>
Unlike your travel to Copenhagen, you said nothing where you went, what you did, whom your meet, how you felt. In fact, no message at all for your first night in London. So I lost connection to you even without knowing <strong>whether you had arrived safely</strong> at all. Such thing was not the first time, so I began to worry just as before. Did you realize how important is your safety to me? (<strong>No need</strong> to answer, as I wrote above.)
</p>


<p>
And when at last I called you successfully, you said you were outside and just asked me that if there was something practical. Then the call ended. Well, at that time, all my attention was concerning on the fact that you had arrived safely. So I didn’t give a thought to why you were seemed to be unconventional to talk with me, why you seemed to behave a little strangely.
</p>


<p>
But you still told me nothing about your trip until 25, August. So I checked your hotmail, and I found you hadn’t booked any hotel at all. I couldn’t understand. Did you go to Reading directly? Did you use another email address? But this is usual email you used for booking a hotel.
</p>


<p>
So, all this led to some rough idea. And I was tormented by this idea. Finally, just at that midnight, I found that I happened to have a dishonor way to check it. Yes, I loaded in your email box of university, which happened to be the only place you used a lot but I didn't know the password. (You should learn more about basic knowledge of computer.) In fact, I wasn’t interested in this mail box at all since you only used it for something practical, especially, for something related to math.
</p>


<p>
Then, I knew,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>I know nothing.</em></strong>
</p>


<p>
I suppose you received the offer of X at 22, May for the travel of London in the letter of that day, right? Anyway, this <strong>doesn’t</strong> matter. What matters, then? I think it’s that I knew <strong>nothing</strong> about your acceptance of the offer, your plans of travel, your letters in these three months.
</p>


<p>
I knew that you will go to England, I knew you will go to visit Xm in Reading. And in August, you mentioned that Q said you could go to visit X, so I knew you <strong>maybe</strong> go to visit him (in a totally different sense). Of course, this is your trip, you needn’t ask my permission or tell me your plan. And you knew me, I also had no will to know your plan (since I didn't go with you). Because, I <strong>thought</strong> you will tell me <strong>all</strong> you want to share with me when you travel to England. But you even didn’t tell me X will meet you at train station in London. If I <strong>knew</strong> this at least, there would be much less worries about your safety when I lost the connection with you.
</p>


<p>
If I go to travel with some girl <strong>alone</strong> for a week, I <strong>believe</strong> I will let you know it. Moreover, I <strong>believ</strong>e I will ask you if you mind it. In fact, I <strong>believe</strong> I will never do such a travel no matter what a friend the girl is to me. Yes, of course, if I go to travel with my sister, I won’t ask for your opinion, but I think I will share every interesting thing with you. But I <strong>DIDN’T</strong> know X now is your new brother until that midnight. In fact, I <strong>DIDN’T</strong> know he even can be called your friend. Yes, sometimes you told me a little of this, a bit of that about him. And I agreed with you that we have many things in common. But it was too hard for me to figure out this surprise you gave to me. Too less clues if this surprise was another birthday gift for me which you prepared for a long time.
</p>


<p>
I think it’s really nice experience to read your and X’s letters, I mean it, if I were someone else. I can remember some similar feelings when I was writing letters with Sq when I was in my high school. Due to the inefficient post system in China at that time, I wrote a letter, then it took one week for her to receive, and another week for me to receive the reply. I remember the feelings how I accounted the days in the waiting for the next letter, how fast my heart beaten with the letter in my hand, and how excited when I finally read the letter when there was no one around. You asked me about this several times, but it is not that I don’t want to share my memories and feelings with you. It’s just the time, eight years. I didn’t keep the letters. I can’t remember any practical thing we discussed, any feelings we shared. And I don’t know how to express clearly such faraway, faded scenes, emotions, feelings. And I joked that what a pity you didn’t have such an experience when you were in high school. Now, I think, I can say there is no more pity for you on this thing.
</p>


<p>
As I remembered, what we had written were naïve. And they were not love letters, even no strong emotions were ever expressed. In fact, I think I never used to expressed emotions and feelings strongly or directly - as you may feel - though perhaps there was great tempest inside of some peaceful words.
</p>


<p>
Oh, there is one thing I wrote to her I won’t forgot. They are just some simple words: I wish I could be her friend forever. Now, are we still friends eight years later? You know, every year we just had several messages or even zero to each other. She is on her way of the voyage of life, I am on mine. She shared things through her QQ zone, and I read it from time to time, in silence. I said nothing to her no matter she met happiness or sadness, even her birthday. I just - as a friend - wish her living a happy life, meeting some true love with someone else. The friendship in Papillon is moving, truly, but I feel it's lucky that most of us never meet such a case in real life. So I think, there is another kind of friendship, which is silent like peaceful lake water. I just stand at a long distance, happy to see that a old friend lives well, that's enough for me. Because I know, I have a unique, a special friend just before my eyes in recent five years. No, maybe I should say I had.
</p>


<p>
You know, there are other two close friend of mine. One of them is a girl, Ff, I guess you have more interests. I hope you noted that I paid very attention to the distance between us, since you have read all the message between us on QQ. Because I always knew that I had promised something to you. And I believe a promise is a promise, as Forrest Gump told Lieutenant Dan about the shrimp boat. I hope you remember what I promised, it was that question which I borrowed from ending of Whisper of the Heart, I asked it after our long long kiss in that little woods. Your answer was yes, but I know, at that time, how could you say no or say that you need time to consider it. In fact, more earlier, when I asked you to be my girlfriend at that summer of 2010, when you replied with a yes. I had promised something to you already, though I just kept it in my heart. That is, I view the establishing of a relation as a promise, which means that there is something I should never try to do. So, just immediately after that, when I met Ff in that August, when I found she is special to me, I knew I must be careful to the distance, becasue I had a promise for you.
</p>


<p>
I don't know what do you think of her from the deep of your heart, but I guess you don't dislike her at least, especially after she accompanied you on that nights, on which you had to live alone in that house. Moreover, I remember you once asked me, what would happend if I met her first. I told you the truth, and you were sad. I'm sorry I was so stubborn, it was so easy to say something nice to you, but I chosed to say the truth to you. However, it's just an assumption, maybe happened in another universe.
</p>


<p>
What really happend in this world is that I met you first, and I am stubborn. So, then we went through these five years together. You encountered two terrible time in these five years. The first time, you even didn't tell me the thing unitl the end of winter, the begin of new semester. I could imagine that it was because you didn't totally trust me at that time, you didn't know what will I react. I could understand, we just began our relationship half a year, you didn't know me well at that time. But, then, I knew, you knew me from now on, that I am stubborn. You knew that I am alwasy there, stand by you, never leave. Until now.
</p>


<p>
I kept this promise, I paid attension, I reminded myself to be careful because I know it’s easy to say love, to promise, but it's a different thing to maintain it. It never be easy. If it was easy, there would not be so many sad love stories on 知乎. So I have to be careful to the distance to other girls. Since I know such thing may lead to hurt you, which I never want.
</p>


<p>
And I still keep the promise, so I <strong>won’t</strong> break our relation first.
</p>


<p>
Love, as a word, is so easy to say, and maybe, is also easy to begin, but it never be easy to maintain as I must say again. So I preferred to be careful with this word as you may felt in these years. But I did want to achieve this word, as I view it as a promise until my death. And I tried.
</p>


<p>
The promise is one of the three vertices of the love triangular. Another vertex is closeness. When I first knew by that accident you had skyped with X, I was just in the pure shock how could you accomplish this: to skype without letting someone <strong>knew</strong>, someone who lived together with you day and night in a room of 9 square meters in this year. Later, when I found you had written so many letters at so many nights and had another time of Skype. I was not shocked anymore, I just <strong>felt</strong> how wrong I was if I thought you were sitting just one meter behind me when you were writing these letters at those night. As for the Skype, I <strong>felt</strong> that it seemed I didn't live with you together at all. Maybe all these letters are just my imagination, or living with you together is a hallucination? (<strong>No</strong> need to answer, again. They are just feelings, just words.) I <strong>never</strong> think you have no right to write or to skype to anyone you want. But I was just too confusing, and shocked, since according the time you skyped around the end of June and my poor memory, I think I should be there, just before your eyes. Where were you, where was I? How far away is the distance between you and me? How couldn’t I know such thing? Why you told me <strong>nothing</strong>?
</p>


<p>
I have to emphasize again, I <strong>don’t</strong> blame you or accuse of anything. I am just terribly trapped by my feelings and thoughts. And I’m really sorry if you feel some negative emotions when you read my letter. But, on the other hand, I think this would be a lesson.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>Life is not a song, sweetling. Someday you may learn that, to your sorrow.</strong></em>
</p>


<p>
We have to face these negative things in our lives, we can’t be children forever, and winter is always coming. So, as I imagine, you will also receive a challenge as you received this letter. Not coming from me, it comes from yourself as I suppose. But I hope you to be brave. Like Harry, braveness is not fearless, but go forward to face the challenge with your fear.
</p>


<p>
And I must also apologize for reading your emails without your permission. And for X, too.
</p>


<p>
So I thought I had mistaken another thing. I thought you agreed with me that we share <strong>everything</strong>. But now I see maybe you want more private room in fact, otherwise I think you won’t tell me nothing at all from 10 May to 25 August. But you never mentioned it, you never say you want to have some close friend without need to let me know.
</p>


<p>
Yes, in fact, I don’t agree with this: lovers can keep their close friends without letting the other know.
</p>


<p>
Back to five years ago, when I was trying to get close with you, you said you agreed with me that 杨绛 and 钱钟书 are an idealistic model for lovers. It should not be 徐志摩 with 张幼仪, 林徽因, or 陆小曼, as I suppose our likings of tragedy doesn't mean we want it to happen on ourselves.
</p>


<p>
How luckily, I saw we were on a way as we hoped, to follow them. Now I can’t even remember when we began to know each other's passwords for QQ, mail boxes, etc. They were so natural as I felt. Without I realized, we checked mails, we read messages, we handled the everyday practical things, we used our bank cards, without considering to distinguish you and me. I knew all your close friend before May 2015, and you knew all mines too. And you could even use my QQ to imitate me to talk with my sister with nothing sensed by my sister. And I was so happy to see that we had more and more things loved by both of us. On the other hand, I also thought we had more and more tolerances on our differences.
</p>


<p>
I never required you to have the ideal, principal, hobby - which I treasure - as the same with me if I remember rightly. And I never want our relation to be your 围城 which traps you. Whenever you want to leave, to be outside, please just let me know. And I do hope you can be rid of any sorry, pressure, guilty for doing so.
</p>


<p>
And, of course, I must say, thank you, thank you for spending these five years with me. Thanks for your not running away when I always sat down beside you in linear algebra courses. Thanks for your supports on the seminar affairs until the last in the second year of our college time. Thanks for your acceptances of my invitations to take those courses in the university: the history of modernization of universities, an introduction to western cultures, the history of western literatures, the thirteen lectures on Weimar Republic, an introduction to the culture of Ancient Greek, the analysis of dramas of Shakespeare. Thanks for all your gifts you sent me on my every birthday in these years. Thanks for watching so many movies together with me… The list can be extended much much longer, and longer if we could have five years after five years.
</p>


<p>
But I am sorry that I can’t say I could extend it forever. Forever, a beautiful word, truly. But I suppose that you noted I said it very very few. Sometimes you wanted some promise from me, but you heard no this word. Since I intend to be very careful with this word. Why? Because I know it’s easy to say, but it is also easy to be gone with wind. But I desired this word for us with my whole heart, otherwise I wouldn't like to send you a ring with symbol ∞ as in 时尼的肖像 by Shinji Kajio. I was so happy that I could sent you Tiffany Infinity as the Christmas gift of this year. I could still recall that night, due to my stupidness, I had to walk a long way back, with a Tiffany Infinity in my arms. At that time, I was walking alone on a country road along those dark woods in the weak moonlight, without any human being, any car, any house light, or even any animal or even any sounds around. But I wasn't afraid, I thought it was just something interesting, some story we could recall for fun when we are old and grey many years later. And I believe I will be much happier when I could claim that, I loved and will love you forever, just before my last breath.
</p>


<p>
But who knows future? How can I make sure that I can keep the promise if I wasn't a foreteller? What I am sure includes the past, and I hope you can always find happiness in our five years spent together whenever you recall them. What I can control, includes, though maybe not totally, is now, this very moment. So I will try my best to keep the words I said to you in the past. I don’t like to say anything I can’t 100% sure to you. So I can only use this word, forever, in that card I gave you, I mean it by my heart.
</p>


<p>
But I know, to be a man of his words is hard. I never think I kept all my words to others. And now, there are some words gone with wind: I won’t be back to B soon after my arrival in Germany, for the baggage (I will take away all I need), and for you, any more.
</p>


<p>
I think our five years together can be viewed as the opening chapter of your and mine unique voyages of life, with so much happiness and some sadness, with so much laughter and some tears. Though I thought I would have only one chapter through the begin to the end.
</p>


<p>
But I wish you, as written in that card, thousandfold love, on your 25th Nameday and forever, and happiness unbounded, though even if you don't want to run after them together with me any more.
</p>


<p>
Well, after so many words, words, words, I think I feel much better now. In fact, from that midnight to this very moment, when I am writing this letter beyond the earth ten kilometers, on my flight from Wuhan to Paris, I can’t sleep at all. Especially from that midnight to the sunset of 26 August, I turned over and over, my mind was totally out of my control. Then what a relief when I heard my nephew, my sister and my brother-in-law were getting up, because then I only needed to pretend as I had a nice sleep for a small while. But when I went through half of Wuhan city to fix your computer and return the computer to your mother, I felt myself like a walking dead. Where I came from? Who was I? Where was I going? My mind seemed to be empty and full at the same time. And I can guess my smile was rather ugly when I met your mother at Z Station.
</p>


<p>
However, such agony is nothing, I think.
</p>


<p>
After so many words, I am also wondering if I should turn from mathematics to writings like 王小波? No, no, no, I think I can't write down such words:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>人的一切痛苦，本质上都是对自己的无能的愤怒。</strong></em>
</p>


<p>
Now it's midnight of 31 August. I will soon finish this letter and sent it to you, as you required. I planed to leak nothing to you to let you find that I know the things now. But it's really hard than I thought. It's so easy for you to find that I behaved strangely. I'm sorry for this.
</p>


<p>
You asked me if I am angry on 28 August. I said no, as I am not angry to you. But maybe I should say yes, because I am angry to myself, as Wang pointed out.
</p>


<p>
And I have to admit that I am envious too. In your letter on X’s birthday, you said you felt you could talk anything with him now. This seems really faster than the steps of you and me if you really meant it.
</p>


<p>
They are kind words, I know, just like many other words in your letters. Kind words to someone, but maybe poisoned wine to someone else, as I feel. I imagine, if you knew I will read all words written by you, like we usually did, would you still write like what I read? I suppose you never want to hurt anyone as intended. But you know Eddard Stark well, he intended to hurt no one, he behaved as his nature, a honorable, justice nobleman. But what he did led to his own death, to his wife's death, to his oldest son’s death, to the fall of his family, to the war and chaos of whole kingdom. Did he do anything wrong? Anyway, I never blame him. If Teiresias can speak, I guess he will say that it will come what will. You are so kind, you response kind words by kind words, passion by passion. But how can you be kind to all the people at the same time?
</p>


<p>
On the other hand, I am pondering, what if they are just words, like wind? If so, what is true feeling of you? Why did you say these words? I don’t know what X will feel in such possibility. But I guess it won't be positive. Are you the Mirror of Erised, always projects others to yourself to bring happiness to others? Sometimes I doubt. No, I hope this is not true. Please listen to the whisper of your heart, <strong>become who you are</strong>.
</p>


<p>
X replied that he thought one look is enough to know what you are thinking. I thought I could, too, and I guess it lasted for some time, maybe at least to May 2015. But now, I find it become really hard. Why you said you had seen many times of the Zhao Ruhan’s pen name in 科幻世界? I feel that it is because that such a white lie can make your words more dramatic. But what a drama the reality is, as now we may see. Do you agree with me about this?
</p>


<p>
In your letters, there is so much passion, closeness, and plans. And it made me feel that I was nobody to you, or I didn’t exist at all. Yes, you mentioned you have a boyfriend at the beginning. But that’s all. If I was the person you cared for most, you loved most, as you said on 30 August, why you didn’t mention me after that? Had you ever visited Louvre alone, or with someone else? Where did you get the book Der Zauberberg? How did you know Nibelungenlied? I can see, in many many times, I should be there in your stories that you shared with X, but why you didn’t mention me? Did you think a close friend or a brother will mind you mention your boyfriend? X shared a lot about his sister, his family and you also mentioned you family. But if I was the person as you told me, why I didn’t appear at all in such places?
</p>


<p>
If you could talk anything with him, why did you say it was Q’s course made you decided to be his Ph.D student? I don’t mean it was a lie, but according to my memory, there were more. If you explain it through and through, can you till avoid that I appeared in your story?
</p>


<p>
Maybe I am just too blind. When you asked me to help you with the typing of notes of seminars this summer, I just thought you wanted to be lazy for a while to relax. Now I can’t stop to think that in fact you were so busy with something else. And maybe you were so busy that you had failed to prepare a gift for my birthday.
</p>


<p>
These are just words, you <strong>don’t</strong> need to defend. What I want to say is, <strong>words are wind</strong>, it’s easy to say something, but what can you do indeed for it? You said you care me most, but what do you think how will I feel when I read these words you wrote? What do you think how will I feel when I find you told me nothing about something in more than three months?
</p>


<p>
And when you said it’s better in some sense for us to live separated in next year, I agreed with you. I knew is based on our deep understanding of each other. And at that moment, I never thought the distance in physics will depart us, or make us distance. But now how can I stop to think that maybe there is some other reason you don’t want to tell me? If I still live with you together when X comes to B, what a situation will it be? If I knew nothing, when we sit together around a table in the restaurant of university, what will happen? I will just think he is a visitor, but he maybe think he is your brother, as you think so. How will you behave, what will you say? <strong>No</strong> need to answer these bad guesses, please, I just need to write down what I think, let it hurt, and then it maybe scab.
</p>


<p>
Maybe I just got into another parallel universe like Coherence from time to time? The one I thought was you, in your letters, in fact live in another parallel universe? And I happened to connect your mail box in a different universe? How I wish this is true.
</p>


<p>
Does this sound I am blaming you? I <strong>don't</strong> want to blame you, and I do <strong>not</strong> blame you. Moreover, please don't blame yourself, too, or fall to some negative emotions. No one have the right to ask you be truly honest to him or her. But please be honest to yourself. What do you want, whom do you want to be, what life do you want to live, what is the true feeling in your heart?
</p>


<p>
Sometimes, when we were angry with each other, I think you found that I always preferred to say nothing. Yes, I know in such time, it’s so easy to say some words that hurt you. But I never want to hurt you. So I preferred to be silent. But this time, I write my feelings, my thoughts through and through. I know they will hurt you this time and I am so sorry. But please don’t cry. And please be brave.
</p>


<p>
And I will be brave, too, to face my sorrow. I felt I was young Werther five years ago when I met you (Yes, I knew it sounded stupid later), now maybe I have to admit that I turn out to be Albert at last. You can try to imagine, if you were me, when someone else said he is always together with your - well, I don't repeat the titles anymore - in his heart and thought, now and forever. What would you think? No, I have to say again, you <strong>needn't</strong> to response to anything here. I was just battling with myself, just mad at myself. I have to write my thoughts, my feelings, which haunt in mind without any stop, in order to face my sorrows.
</p>


<p>
Do you know what Mr. Wang said about how to seize some courage in his course of the history of western literatures? Oh, we can always draw some courage from death. Think of death, be afraid of death, then maybe you could find something terrible is not worth to be afraid any more. So please to live bravely, like Nausicaä, to live hopefully, like San, and to live even with great loss, even when le vent se lève.
</p>


<p>
And please listen to the whisper of your heart, please make decisions carefully.
</p>


<p>
Let us suppose that I hadn’t existed at all. Would you still claim that X is brother to you and you are a sister to him? And he? Or if you are single from now on, without considering the influence of me, would you keep this relation with him forever without going head more? And he? You don’t need to say any words to me so hastily as you did on 30 August. You don’t need to say that you <strong>think</strong> he <strong>feels</strong> that you are just a sister to him. Maybe it matters what I think, what he feels, but, to you, what matters most is yours. So please listen to the whisper of your heart.
</p>


<p>
Oh, at last, there is another thing I promised to share with you. It’s the story of House Targaryen, in fact, of Egg. When I read the history of House Targaryen, I found George R. R. Martin had written it as his consistent harshness. At some page, you can find a little lovely princess bring to so much laughter to the old king, but just on the next page, you will find what a ruthless ruler she become. But what a relief, Martin finally wrote some story different, about the king Aegon V, named Egg by his brother, maester Aemon. One of things he did unusually and bravely is, to marry for love. When every lord plays the game of thrones, how can he be run for love as his will. Even Eddard Stark can’t do this, as you know. Moreover, all his children followed their father’s example, which brought much trouble, you know, marriages of a king’s children are just tools for the game. And his grand grandson, Rhaegar, also made some decisions that shocked the kingdom, and shattered the kingdom, for true love. So, now in modern time, is it easier or harder to acquire the true love? So, please listen to your whisper of heart. And remember, the path of love never be smooth, whether in ancient or modern times.
</p>


<p>
And please be thoughtful, be careful, be brave to make decisions. Do you remember maester Aemon imagines conversations with Egg before he passes away in Season 5? That is quite different with the original book. But some words he says to Egg in the book are kept (for John Snow):
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Kill the boy within you, I told him the day I took the ship for the Wall. It takes a man to rule. An Aegon, not an Egg. Kill the boy and let the man be born.</em>
<br>
Aemon is leaving for the Wall, to let Egg rule alone as a true king. But he knows, though Egg has already grown sons of his own, yet in some ways Egg is still a boy, still has an innocence, a sweetness which Aemon loves. But, as I guess, and according to the Egg’s rule later, it is always not easy to make decisions, even after be mature. And when John Snow also feels hard to make some decision, Aemon said this again (maybe a little different from Season 5):
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>I think you have the strength in you to do the things that must be done. Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy and let the man be born.</em>
</p>


<p><em>
S,
<br>
once humble maester of Citadel Fanart,
<br>
wishes thousandfold love,
<br>
on her 25th Nameday and forever,
<br>
and happiness unbounded.
</em></p>
