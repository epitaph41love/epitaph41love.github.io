<p>
In this email, I will be totally honest, to myself and to you.
</p>


<p>
When you send me the message that we have been friends for 1981 days, I don't feel surprised, since now for me, you are just like a family, only 5 years are enough to make someone to be your family. I still remember 5 years ago when we are still not familier with each other, you are just a guy who always a little active in the class :-) Then you began to talk to me in QQ, I got surprised at first, but after some chats, I realized that you are special :-) Then you took me to the Dushuhui, in there, I met the people I never seen before. My life before I met you, maybe it was normal just like most of people does, but after I met you, I begin to see so many possibilities it could be! So I have to say, you’ve changed my life. We went to climb the mountain together and walked around the east lake together, those are all the precious memories for me. More importantly, you had recommended me so many books which I never heard before that :-) But I was happy to try them and I really like them. Although at the first, I still thought you are a little strange, the strange looks, the strange clothes and the strange mind:-) But then I got used to it and learned to understand your feelings and read the book you like and take the interesting courses with you, and now I don't think your mind is strange anymore, in the contrary, I think it is great. The strange look, I can do nothing, I still need a time to get used to it if I do not see you for a long time, which I have already told you :-) But I could change your dressing :-). Ok, now it comes to our first kiss, I still remember that you ask many times for the permission, it was odd for me, because I was shy at that time, how could I say, yes, you can kiss me :-) Anyway, you kiss me in the end, it was magnificent, I had never the feeling before that :-) After the first kiss, we had so many time of passion in the campus, they are the memories I won’t forget my whole life… Then, we came to France, and you seems to have problem adapting to the new life here, so things went not so well with you, before this, in Wuhan, your situation is always better than me, so you are just like a big brother to me whom I admire but after we came to France, sometimes I need to support and comfort you when you didn’t find a good place to go, this is a different experience , then we know that we can not only share the happiness but also the sorrow. Finally, you came to B, we spent all most all the days together, and at first there were some problems but slowly we made things out, you really gave me the comfort in this place where we are not familier with, although you always let me to communicate with people which made me feel tired, sometimes I hope you could do this instead of me, but the joy we had is more than this, we watched the movies together, made the lunch and dinner together, and you are always available to carry the heavy bags for me, what’s more, if I have the questions in math and history, you are always there to reply :-) In the last year we spent together, sometimes you are just like a boy knowing nothing whom I need to take care of and sometimes like a big brother who can help me and share things with me. And thank you so much for your birthday present, I can really see you are doing it with your heart, I take the card you gave me all the day, can you understand how I feel when I saw you put a ‘Once’ in all your titles? Heartbreaking…
</p>


<p>
Now I want to talk about my feelings to X which you may be interested in. The first week we met in Wuhan, I had a strange feeling like we had already met before, the feeling of been closed, I don't know why, maybe because he is nice and has something in common with you. Yes, as you wrote in the letter, one week is too short for me to visit him in London, but after that week, when I said goodbye to him, I had the feeling of being sad and depressed but maybe this feeling would go with wind if he didn't send me the email after that. When I found that he had also the feeling of being closed to me, I thought I should tell him that I already had a boyfriend in case he will misunderstand, so I wrote that letter which you have seen, his reply is cool so I feel safety after that letter because I thought I had made things clear. And it was a nice experience writing to him, in the past three month, we got a better knowledge of each other, I am sure he is a nice guy just like you. I had the doubt of my feelings to him for few times, if I didn't meet you, maybe I would like this guy to be honest. But I am also very clear that if I didn't meet you, I won't be the girl today and you are already like family to me, you means a lot to me and I can't leave you just because of him. So I said nothing, in my heart, this frequency of writing letters won't be long, because one day, he will also meet someone he loves and forms a family and I will give him the best wish for this. So when he asked me to visit him in London, I didn't see this is inappropriate, since for me, it is just meeting a good friend. Then it comes to the question, why I didn't tell you about this. I think it carefully these days, I think it is because my feeling to him is special, this is the experience I didn't have before, I am not clear how should I deal with it, and I didn't know how could I told you such things, because maybe you can understand me, but it will hurt you anyway, I don't want to do this for some feeling I am not sure even myself. So I came to London, the first day I arrived, I had called you in the train for many times, but it was impossible to connect. And after I arrived in the hotel, I was too tired because I haven't sleep so well for days and I forgot to leave you a message. I am really sorry to make you so worried. Now I would like to share my trip in London with you. X went to the station to pick me up, I have to say, I was really happy to see him again. It rained almost all the days, but anyway, I like rains, so it was fine to me. He planed everything so carefully, I could see he has prepared it with heart and the plan is really full, so everyday I left in the morning and went back very late and tired. We went to the Promrose hill, that day it rained badly, so it was not a nice weather to go to the hill, but you know what I found? I found out a etching in the top of the hill "I have conversed with the spiritual Sun. I saw him on Primrose Hill" :-) Sounds familier? It is the place where the silver hair girl from Iceland in '8 senses' sees the sunrise! I really want to share the happiness with you at that moment. And X also took me to the seaside near London, it was magnificent! We are both astonished by the beauty of nature. After one week, I think maybe at first I only saw the sameness between you and him, but after this week, I also see some differences between you two, he doesn't read as many history books as you do :-) his connection with his family (parents and sister) is much more than you and me and he had never lost un umbrella :-) Everything was fine until I found out your strangeness. Then I know it is the time to talk with you and him. I began to think carefully what is exactly my feelings to you and him, so now in this letter is what I get these days in my head, it is still not that clear but at least clearer than before. In the last day, I talked to him about you and he also told me his feelings to me, yes you are right, I should never say in hasty what is other's thought. I have to say, what he said to me is moving, just like what you’ve said to me years ago, but this time I couldn't give him the answer, I really need some reflect and thinking…
