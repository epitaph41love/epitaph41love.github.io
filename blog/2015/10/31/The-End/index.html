<p>
<strong>Gare d'Avignon TGV</strong>
</p>


<p>
13:23:43
<br>
R sat on a chair alone, which located on the second floor of gare d'Avignon TGV. She was reading the book <em>我们仨</em>. S stood behind R, leaning against the window, watching her reading. She didn't see him.
</p>


<p>
14:07:28
<br>
R opened her cup to drink some water, spilt a little on the book. She took a paper towel out from her blue bag to clear the water. S stood behind R, leaning against the window, watching her. She didn't see him.
</p>


<p>
14:46:35
<br>
R took her phone out from her bag to check the time. Then she put the book back to her bag with all other things.
</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not sit for another while? Still have time.
</p></p>

<p>
R turned back, found S was there.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had felt that somebody was behind me. But I didn't want to turn back to have a look because I was reading. I should turn back!
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's too early to leave. Why not sit a bit more?
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Er, I want to check the platform for the train.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, fine. Let's figure it out.
</p>


<p>
R and S went to the board which showed the time and the number of platform for the trains.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well... Ok, the platform is just out there.
</p>


<p>
S and R went back the chairs, sat down.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did you come here?
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know. I was just in my room. Then, next moment, I found I was behind you. I don't know why. You know, just like people in <em>Sense 8</em>. So I guess in fact I'm still in my home, what you see is not me, but a spirit of mine.
</p>


<p>
R smile slightly.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long did you stand there?
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know. Maybe an hour. Why do you read <em>我们仨</em>?
</p>


<p>
R said nothing.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I watched you reading for an hour. You skipped out a lot of pages, why?
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are just too sad, I don't want to read.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok...
</p>


<p>
R and S said nothing for a while.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you see the bridge of avignon?
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, of course. But it has been destroyed, less than a half...
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, yes, I know. But it is famous, you know. And I guess you know the song, <em>Sur le Pont d'Avignon</em>...
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did you visit the Papal palace?
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, but it looks really old and coarse...
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah, tha't true, since it was built in 14th century...
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you go to see it, or the bridge?
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. No need.
</p>


<p>
R and S said nothing for a while.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I need to see them alone? It's enough for me to read things about them on internet. If I go to see them, I need more motivation. For example, to see them with a companion is a good reason.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have words to say? To me?
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's that?
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the time.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please tell me.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. They are too much. We don't have enough time for that now. I will tell you when we are on the train.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are you going? Do you have ticket?
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's get on the train. Let me take the suitcase.
</p>


<p>
S and R went to the platform. They boarded the train and sat down.
</p>


<p>
<strong>On the train</strong>
</p>


<p>
15:15:17
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you can say.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why you sit here? You take exactly my place. Your seat is there.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you know? Anyway, it doesn't matter. Not necessary to care the number.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that's right. But how can you exactly take my seat?
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are you going? Paris?
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well... What do you want to tell me?
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not hurry. I will tell you after we change the train at L.
</p>


<p>
R said nothing. S was watching her.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are you watching?
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You, of course. It's several months that we don't see each other. Let me watch you, quietly, for a while.
</p>


<p>
R smile lightly. R yawned.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you tired? You can sleep for an hour. I can wake you up when we arrive L.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I'm exhausted in this week to travel around.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can sleep.
</p>


<p>
R closed her eyes and began to sleep. S was watching her.
</p>


<p>
16:13:31
<br>
R woke up because of noise. S was watching her, with eyes moist.
<br>
R was rubbing her eyes.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fell asleep.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, I know... You can always fall asleep at any case. I know so well.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you crying?
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just feel very happy.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please don't be sad.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's really just happiness, nothing more.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we arriving?
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, yes. We have ten minutes to find the train.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are you going? To B?
</p>


<p>
S said nothing.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you booked a hotel?
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The train stops. Now we go.
</p>


<p>
R and S left the train and went to station. They found the right platform and were waiting the train.
</p>


<p>
16:22:46
<br>
R and S boarded the train to B and sat down.
</p>


<p>
<strong>On the other train</strong>
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you can speak.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, maybe. Did you recieve my last letter? There is a song.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm coming because I just want to let you know, I've found a brightness which is always with me.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's that?
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't you guess?
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No idea.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok. So please just listen. I want to explain it through and through.
</p>


<p>
R was listening.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, in fact, I was just a self-righteous foolish boy. So, I know, when it's time for me to leave this world, I will regret for many many things. So I come, and I will make at least one thing less to regret. I mean, I have to come, to see you, face to face, to tell you some words, otherwise I will definitely regret for this.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, do you remember, in our old days, you always like to ask me: Do you like me? How much do you like me? And, do you love me? How much do you love me? Many times, I prefered to answer other than words, because I did not know how to answer by words. And you maybe felt a little dispointed for my unclear answer. I'm sorry I couldn't give a clear answer before, since I really didn't know what can be called love. Yes, they are just words, costing noting, easy to say. However, it's hard for me to say these words. You know, I won't say these words to you before I make it clear, though maybe the answer is always there, covered by chaos.
</p>


<p>
R was listening.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, I know.
</p>


<p>
R was listening.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the love I want to talk about is not that kind of love which is came from blood. What I want to talk is that love appears between two souls who never met before, who never knew the existence of each other before. For me, I once lived in crowds, meanwhile lived alone for 20 years, then I met you, who drived my solitary away.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, there are so many people in this world. And how many people could a person may know in 20 years through all kinds of ways? Maybe not too many, but not few, too. However, all in all, what I knew is that you were the most special one, the only one, to me. There are a few people special to me, and I know you also have some.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, you know, though there are so many roses blooming in the world, but only one rose is special to <em>le petit prince</em>. Do you remember why? <em>C'est le temps que tu as perdu pour ta rose qui fait ta rose si importante</em>. Le temps que tu as <strong>perdu</strong> will turn to memories. They are the basis of feelings, such as love. So, if we suppose that we lose all the memory about each other, how could we be special to each other? So I think the time, which turned into memories, will be the basis for feelings like specialness, affection, and love.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to love, is quite different from, to like. To like, I think, is only to use for nice, beautiful, gorgeous things. But to love is much more beyond that. It can be used for anything no matter it's good or not, as in all the marriage vows.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess there is no perfect human being in this world. So, when I am attracted by you, how could I stop to show my precious treasures to draw you attention? I can imagine I will try my best to make you happy, to comfort your sadness, to share every wondering things I know in world with you. And I will agree with every words you said to keep any possible unpleasantness away. Moreover, if you also do the same things for me, our happiness will double and double... I think this should exactly be called the fondness, but not the love yet. It may or may not be the beginning of a love.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural thing in the following is to get close, to expose the real souls of each other. And I think it could be a really long time. I believe one week is far from enough, but how about half year? And five years? As I feel, it could also be a life-span time. Because only the things, happy and sad, got through by both together, will turn to memories indelible. Longer the time <strong>perdu</strong> like this, higher the possiblity to get close to each other's soul. After seeing clearly each other's soul at such a close distance, will one really realize what feeling can be called loving. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, maybe the true beginning of love is the sadness and sorrow. Yes, we will begin to quarrel, to feel dispointed, to be angry with each other. But no matter how, we still care about each other, we will forgive each other, we will turn the sad feelings to be the proof of existence of our love. We will understand, if we can get through the pain and sorrow, then we will appriciate much better the beauty of rainbow after a tempest.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I think I'm very luck. You and me got so close to see each other's soul by all kinds of things and challenges, small and huge, sad and happy... And maybe much more by the things happened in these two months. So what is to love begin to be clear in my eyes. To love, means to keep the souls close on and on, to accept the imperfect part, to hug your unique soul as an ensemble. So I suddenly - in the night of Monday 26 October - understood that my disappointments, my silent angries in the old days... they are nothing at all, just corollaries of love. I didn't sleep at all in that night, because I suddenly understood well such a definition of love. Then I realized much more... Yes, your letters from May to August, your skypes, your travel to London, your reply to X's request, your words in these days, your booking tickets to Avignon... they all do <strong>NOT</strong> matter for me anymore. I found I don't care what you had done and what you will do anymore. And that stupid ideals are also so easy to throw away at the moment... Most important, I realized what is really important after I exclued all things which turned out be no longer important. So, what is that remaining thing, the most important thing? It's just... <strong>I love you</strong>.
</p>


<p>
Some tears came down.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know what's your impression in others' eyes, but for me, I can always recall a picture, no, a movie of you before my eyes. Moreover, this movie is only for me, I know, no one else has ever seen this. And much more beyond this, in fact, I think I had seen your soul, just there, never far away, in these five years. And now I realize that, in fact, I love you from years ago, though I can't tell beginning time now. Maybe I already knew this in the depth of my heart in the old days, but it was never so clear like this moment. Moreover, I think I saw more in these months, and maybe more in this week. But it only let me know that, this love is invariable. Because what I love is just <strong>you</strong>, your unique soul as an ensemble, which exists as memeries in my mind, exists as a part of my life.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now I see, the only important thing for me is just <strong>you</strong>. I know I will never be angry with you if you break something expensive or even I appreciate very much. So how could I hurt you like that in these two months? How foolish I was? Why did I not realize that, for me, nothing is more important than <strong>you</strong>, no mather how precious that thing is... But now I see that I still put the cart before the horse... All in all, it's <strong>you</strong> and <strong>me</strong> who built this relationship. How can it compare with <strong>you</strong> that relationship we built in these five years? If we could be brave and appreciate love, like in <em>Harry Potter</em>, then I guess we could let this relationship be reborn in fire like a phoenix.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, there is another question you like to ask in our old days: how much do I love you? Now I can answer: how much you hurt me then how much I love you.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, I remember what I remember in these five years we spent together, so I found finally that, I can claim, I love you, <strong>forever</strong>. Since this love has a basis of five years full of eternal memories. And I know there is no way to eliminate them, except death. Oh, and except that I get Alzheimer when I become old. Anyway, so now you see what is that brightness always with me... It is just my love for you, which is almost forever.
</p>


<p>
Tears came streaming down. R smiled lightly.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the irony is, I just realized this definition and this love after realizing that I have really lost you in this week. Why can't I realize the things at last week? Oh, yes, yes, I lost you, our relation has broken, then a whisper in my heart just told me, that I love you, which still and always exists there. What a parodox! Since now such a love for you has nothing to do with you... And the pain. Yes, maybe it was just that pain of losting you make me be smart enough to see what is really important.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I also realized much more clearly what sorrows and fears I brought to you in these two months... How I wish that I could stay in B for the doctorial study... If I could see your face everyday, I think there wouldn't be the second letter, and those messages, phone calls after 31 August... Moreover, I think I also see more clearly about my own soul. Its weaknesses and imperfects. I could feel why you like to write to X: there was something I didn't give you... When we were in the fourth year of bachlor, and when I planned to go USA and you were prepared to go France, I always thought, I should write lettters to you in the followings years in which we have to be separated. In some sense, what X wrote was just what I wished to write in that case. But could I write better? And would you like my letters? I don't know. Maybe in some other parallel universal, if existed, at this same moment, I am just writting an interesting letter to reply your previous letter in some place in USA, where far away from B... But our souls are close just like it should be, and you never feel something special for X, since your heart is full...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now I see how I am blind... If I could go back one week ago, there wouldn't be some stupid "au revoir", I would go directly to revoir you! If I could go back two month ago, you would not receive the first letter at all, you would see me waiting for you right there in B... Moreover, I desire more, if I could go back one year ago, maybe you will never write to him, if I could pay more attention to your feelings and fill you heart...
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, so, now, after understanding what is most important to me, what I only can do is to try my best to reduce the sorrow and pain that I brought to you...
</p>


<p>
S was watching R in silence. S kissed R. A long time later.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I want to ask you again the same question as before...
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time heals all wounds. Let the time do the right things.
</p>


<p>
S said nothing.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, ok, fine, I see...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already considered this answer this week. So, now I know what I can do for you. I can help you to forget everything about me. Then you will be free from sorrows and fears brought by me through and through.
</p>


<p>
S smiled.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know how I came Avignon? In fact, I came through Apparition. Yes, yes, I am wizard.
</p>


<p>
R smiled.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don't believe me?
</p>


<p>
S pulled out his wand, held it firmly.
</p>


<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obliviate!
</p>


<p>
(The End)
